# 🌍 **EcoSynthAI: Generative AI for Designing Synthetic Ecosystems in Degraded Environments** 🌱

---

## 🛠 **Problem Statement**

Climate change and urbanization have led to **fragmented ecosystems** and **biodiversity loss**. Restoration efforts are slow, expensive, and often fail due to mismatches between introduced species and local environmental conditions.  
**EcoSynthAI** aims to solve this problem by creating a solution that leverages **Generative AI** to design **hyper-localized synthetic ecosystems** that adapt to rapidly changing climates. 🌿🌎

## 🤖 **Gen AI Innovation**

The solution is to train a generative AI model that designs **synthetic, self-sustaining ecosystems** for degraded environments (e.g., deforested areas, urban heat islands, bleached coral reefs). 🌾🌊  
### **How It Works:**

### **Inputs:**
- 🌍 **Soil quality**
- 🌡️ **Climate data**
- 💨 **Pollution levels**
- 🦋 **Regional biodiversity records**
